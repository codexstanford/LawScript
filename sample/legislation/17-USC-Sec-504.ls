(2) In a case where the copyright owner sustains the burden of proving, and the

may increase the award of statutory damages to a sum of not more than $50,000.
In a case where the infringer sustains the burden of proving, and the court finds,
that such infringer was not aware and had no reason to believe that his or her
acts constituted an infringement of copyright, the court in its discretion may
reduce the award of statutory damages to a sum of not less than $100.

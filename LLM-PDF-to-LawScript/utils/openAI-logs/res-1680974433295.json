        "content": "You are task to model a legal text into a lawscript program.\n\nHere is how lawscript work:Section\nA LawScript program is structured into optional named section that match the hierarchy of the legal document it is representing.\n\nSection are declared using the section keyword and can be nested.\n\nsection Section1 {\n  section Part1{\n    // [...]\n  }\n  section Part2 {\n   // [...]\n  }\n}\nA statement can reference to a section using the section reference symbol § or alternatively $ for simplicity.\n\n  // This will refer to Section1\n  §Section1;\n  // This will  refer to Section1 Part1\n  $Section1.Part1;\nStatement\nA LawScript program is a series of statements. Every statements in the program are evaluated independently by the solver.\n\nA statement is a logic expression containing conditions and operator finished by a ;\n\n  // A statement containing a variable. Will be true if the variable is true\n  isLegal;\n\n  // A statement containing  a condition, will be true if the operation return true\n\n  X or Y;\n\nIn Lawscript only 5 operator are supported in statements: and, or, not, cause and before.\n\nPropositional logic operators (and, or, not)\nThe logic operator and, or and not resolve in the following way:\n\nand ,(arity 2)\n\nand\ttrue\tfalse\tunknown\ntrue\ttrue\tfalse\tunknown\nfalse\tfalse\tfalse\tfalse\nunknown\tunknown\tfalse\tunknown\nor ,(arity 2)\n\nor\ttrue\tfalse\tunknown\ntrue\ttrue\ttrue\ttrue\nfalse\ttrue\tfalse\tunknown\nunknown\ttrue\tunknown\tunknown\nnot , (arity 1)\n\ntrue\tfalse\tunknown\nnot\tfalse\ttrue\tunknown\nA traditional alternate notation is supported: &&, ||, !.\n\nFlow operator (cause, before)\nLogic text often use temporal logic, with sometime an expression of causality. LawScript support two flow operator to express such logic:\n\nthe causal operator express with the keyword cause or the symbol -->, used to describe a causal relation between two facts.\nthe time operator express with the keyword before or the symbol ==> used to describe a temporal relation between two facts.\nthe time on operator express with the keyword on used to describe a moment in time.\n  // A damage due to fire\n  Situation {\n    event: Fire\n  }\n\n  -->\n\n  Situation {\n    event: Damage\n  };\n\n\n  // A damage happening after a policy purchase\n\n  Situation {\n    event: PolicyPurchase\n  }\n\n  ==>\n\n  Situation {\n    event: Damage\n  }\nFor the before operator LawScript support a way to specified date or period using the Time {} construct.\n\n  // A Fire before 2025 and after 3 month of renovations.\n\n  Situation {\n    event: Renovation\n  }\n\n  before\n\n  Time {\n    period: 3 * Time.month\n  }\n\n  before\n\n  Situation {\n    event: Fire\n  }\n\n  before\n\n  Time {\n    date: \"01-01-2025\"\n  }\n\n\nAnnotation\nAnnotation are arbitrary pieces of information that are attached to a statement and return by a solver if the instruction they are attached to is TRUE.\n\nAnnotation are declared using the annotation keyword and can contain an hashmap of properties.\n\n  annotation Limit {\n    amount: 200\n  }\n\n  annotation Cancelation\n\nThe annotation apply to the instruction directly left of it\n\n\n  (\n    Situation {\n    event: Fire\n    } annotation InCaseOfFire\n    or\n    Situation {\n     event: Flood\n    } annotation InCaseOfFlood\n  ) annotation InAnyCase\n\nOptionally annotation at the begin of a section will attach to the section itself. Section annotation are valid if one of the statement contain in the section is TRUE\n\n\nsection Section1 {\n  annotation InCaseOfSection1\n\n}\n\nReserved annotation\nThe annotation Text is reserved to describe the legaleese text.\n\n  annotation Text {\n    value : \"Lorem ipsum [...] patapum\"\n  }\nThe annotation Documentation is reserved to documentation added to the model\n\n  annotation Documentation {\n    value: \"We decide to model this way because it make sens\"\n  }\nTypes and variables\nAll variables are also type in LawScript. They are declared the following way: VariableName : VariableType. The default types are:\n\nstring\nnumber\nboolean\ndictionary\n{}\nAssignation are declared the following way VariableName = Value .\n\n\n  Situation : {\n    event: string\n  };\n\n  Location: {\n    address: string,\n    latitude: number,\n    longitude: number,\n    visited: boolean\n  };\n\n  Venue: {\n    location: Location\n  };\n\n  ConcertVenue : Venue;\n\n  // Set ConcertVenue address to \"8 Madison Square Garden\"\n  ConcertVenue.address = \"8 Madison Square Garden\";\n\n  // Set all Location visited property to false. (including ConcertVenue.location.visited)\n  Location.visited = false;\nTypes decorator\nType declaration can be decorated with metadata. This allow to embark accessory information into the types. Decorator apply to the things defined left hand, and use the syntaxe @key=value. A decorator value is either a string or a number\n\nPolicy : {\n  isSigned: boolean\n    @ask=\"Is the policy signed\" \n    @displayName=\"Policy signed\" \n    @documentation=\"A boolean to represent if the policy is payed\"\n    @priority=1,\n  isPremiumPayed: boolean \n    @ask=\"Is the policy premium payed\" \n    @displayName=\"Premium payed\" \n    @documentation=\"A boolean to represent if a policy is payed\"\n    @priority=22,\n  isCanceled: boolean \n    @ask=\"Is the policy canceled\" \n    @displayName=\"Policy canceled\" \n    @documentation=\"A boolean to represent if a policy is cancelled\"\n    @priority=42,\n} @documentation=\"An object that represent a policy\";\nDictionaries\nDictionary are similar to traditional enum, but have metadata attached to their values. They are declared using the keyword dictionary\n\ndictionary Country {\n  AFG: {\n    displayName : \"Afghanistan\", \n    alpha2: \"AF\",\n    alpha3: \"AFG\",\n    numeric: \"004\"\n    },\n  ALB: {\n    displayName: \"Albania\",\n    alpha2: \"AL\",\n    alpha3: \"ALB\",\n    numeric: \"008\"\n  },\n  DZA: {\n    displayName: \"Algeria\",\n    alpha2: \"DZ\",\n    alpha3: \"DZA\",\n    numeric: \"012\"\n  },\n  ASM: {\n    displayName: \"American Samoa\",\n    alpha2: \"AS\",\n    alpha3: \"ASM\",\n    numeric: \"016\"\n  },\n // [...]\n}\nInclude\nIt is possible to import another file into a LawScript program using the keyword include.\n\nImport support path from local file but also remotely from HTTP address.\n\nIf the imported file is of type .csv, import will try to convert the content of the file to a dictionary, using the column primaryKey as a key, or the first column.\n\n  include \"path-to-file.ls\";\n\n  include \"http://example.com/ontology/items\"\n\n  include \"items.csv\"\nRange\nIt is possible to specified a possible range for a numeric value using the [ ... ] operator. This operator can be used to specified strictly greater / smaller that [ and greater/smaller or equals [=\n\n\n  Situation {\n    age: [=21 ... ], // from 21 (included) to infinity,\n    height: [122 ... 187=] // from 122 (excluded) to 187 included,\n    width: [... 100=] // less or equals to 100\n  }\n\nAlternatively, a shorthand notation is supported for range: [operator value] .\n\nSituation  {\n  age: [> 20 year],\n  height : [<= 200 cm],\n  width: [< 100 kg],\n  head: [>= 12 eye]\n};\nObject properties arythmic\nObject property can contain mathematical expression.\n\nThe following mathematical operator are supported: +, -, *, /, %of, ||, ^, &&, ||.\n\nThe following unary operator is supported : !\n\nIt is possible to embed in a mathematical expression a ternary operation: (isTrue) ? true : false\n\n  Situation {\n\n    age: 5 * 3 + 2,\n    isDrunk: alcoholInBlood > 0.5 ? true : false\n\n  }\n\n"

Failure of the individual to notify the temporary employment firm of completion of an employment assignment within three working days of the completion of each employment assignment under a contract of hire shall be deemed a voluntary quit unless the individual was not advised in writing of the duty to notify the temporary employment firm upon completion of an employment assignment or the individual had good cause for not contacting the temporary employment firm within three working days and notified the firm at the first reasonable opportunity thereafter.\n\n(2) To show that the employee was advised in writing of the notification requirement of this paragraph, the temporary employment firm shall advise the temporary employee by requiring the temporary employee, at the time of employment with the temporary employment firm, to read and sign a document that provides a clear and concise explanation of the notification requirement and the consequences of a failure to notify. The document shall be separate from any contract of employment and a copy of the signed document shall be provided to the temporary employee.\n\n(3) For purposes of this lettered paragraph:\n\n(a) “Temporary employee” means an individual who is employed by a temporary employment firm to provide services to clients to supplement their workforce during absences, seasonal workloads, temporary skill or labor market shortages, and for special assignments and projects.\n\n(b) “Temporary employment firm” means a person engaged in the business of employing temporary employees.\n\n\nLawScript:\n"

Voluntary quitting\n#### f. Compelling personal reasons\n#### d. Definition of misconduct\n\nFor the purposes of this subsection, “misconduct” means a deliberate act or omission by an employee that constitutes a material breach of the duties and obligations arising out of the employee’s contract of employment. Misconduct is limited to conduct evincing such willful or wanton disregard of an employer’s interest as is found in deliberate violation or disregard of standards of behavior which the employer has the right to expect of employees, or in carelessness or negligence of such degree of recurrence as to manifest equal culpability, wrongful intent or evil design, or to show an intentional and substantial disregard of the employer’s interests or of the employee’s duties and obligations to the employer. Misconduct by an individual includes but is not limited to all of the following:\n\n##### List item 1\n\nMaterial falsification of the individual’s employment application.\n\n##### List item 2\n\nKnowing violation of a reasonable and uniformly enforced rule of an employer.\n\n##### List item 3\n\nIntentional damage of an employer’s property.\n\n##### List item 4\n\nConsumption of alcohol, illegal or nonprescribed prescription drugs, or an impairing substance in a manner not directed by the manufacturer, or a combination of such substances, on the employer’s premises in violation of the employer’s employment policies.\n\n##### List item 5\n\nReporting to work under the influence of alcohol, illegal or nonprescribed prescription drugs, or an impairing substance in an off-label manner, or a combination of such substances, on the employer’s premises in violation of the employer’s employment policies, unless the individual is compelled to work by the employer outside of scheduled or on-call working hours.\n\n##### List item 6\n\nConduct that substantially and unjustifiably endangers the personal safety of coworkers or the general public.\n\n##### List item 7\n\nIncarceration for an act for which one could reasonably expect to be incarcerated that results in missing work.\n\n##### List item 8\n\nIncarceration as a result of a misdemeanor or felony conviction by a court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n##### List item 9\n\nExcessive unexcused tardiness or absenteeism.\n\n##### List item 10\n\nFalsification of any work-related report, task, or job that could expose the employer or coworkers to legal liability or sanction for violation of health or safety laws.\n\n##### List item 11\n\nFailure to maintain any license, registration, or certification that is reasonably required by the employer or by law, or that is a functional requirement to perform the individual’s regular job duties, unless the failure is not within the control of the individual.\n\n##### List item 12\n\nConduct that is libelous or slanderous toward an employer or an employee of the employer if such conduct is not protected under state or federal law.\n\n##### List item 13\n\nTheft of an employer or coworker’s funds or property.\n\n##### List item 14\n\nIntentional misrepresentation of time worked or work carried out that results in the individual receiving unearned wages or unearned benefits.\n\n### 3. Failure to accept work\n\nIf the department finds that an individual has failed, without good cause, either to apply for available, suitable work when directed by the department or to accept suitable work when offered that individual. The department shall, if possible, furnish the individual with the names of employers which are seeking employees. The individual shall apply to and obtain the signatures of the employers designated by the department on forms provided by the department. However, the employers may refuse to sign the forms. The individual’s failure to obtain the signatures of designated employers, which have not refused to sign the forms, shall disqualify the individual for benefits until requalified. To requalify for benefits after disqualification under this subsection, the individual shall work in and be paid wages for insured work equal to ten times the individual’s weekly benefit amount, provided the individual is otherwise eligible.\n\n#### a. Determining suitable work\n\n(1) In determining whether or not any work is suitable for an individual, the department shall consider the degree of risk involved to the individual’s health, safety, and morals, the individual’s physical fitness, prior training, length of unemployment, and prospects for securing local work in the individual’s customary occupation, the distance of the available work from the individual’s residence, and any other factor which the department finds bears a reasonable relation to the purposes of this paragraph. Work is suitable if the work meets all the other criteria of this paragraph and if the gross weekly wages for the work equal or exceed the following percentages of the individual’s average"

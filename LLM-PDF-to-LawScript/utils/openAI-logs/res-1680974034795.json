Failure to accept work\n#### a. Determining suitable work\n#### c. No employer account charged\n\nNo employer’s account shall be charged with benefits paid by the department for the period, and no employer’s account shall be charged with benefits so paid. However, compensation for service-connected disabilities or compensation for accrued leave based on military service by the beneficiary with the armed forces of the United States, irrespective of the amount of the benefit, does not disqualify any individual otherwise qualified from any of the benefits contemplated herein. A deduction shall not be made from the amount of benefits payable for a week for individuals receiving federal social security pensions to take into account the individuals’ contributions to the pension program.\n\n### 6. Benefits from other state\n\nFor any week with respect to which or a part of which an individual has received or is seeking unemployment benefits under an unemployment compensation law of another state or of the United States, provided that if the appropriate agency of such other state or of the United States finally determines that the individual is not entitled to such unemployment benefits, this disqualification shall not apply.\n\n### 7. Vacation pay\n\n#### a. Payment for vacation pay\n\nWhen an employer makes a payment or becomes obligated to make a payment to an individual for vacation pay, or for vacation pay allowance, or as pay in lieu of vacation, such payment or amount shall be deemed wages as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 40, and shall be applied as provided in paragraph “c” hereof.\n\n#### b. Payment in connection with separation or layoff\n\nWhen, in connection with a separation or layoff of an individual, the individual’s employer makes a payment or payments to the individual, or becomes obligated to make a payment to the individual as, or in the nature of, vacation pay, or vacation pay allowance, or as pay in lieu of vacation. The amount of a payment or obligation to make payment, is deemed wages as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 40, and shall be applied as provided in paragraph “c” of this subsection 7.\n\n#### c. Attribution of wages\n\nOf the wages described in paragraph “a” or paragraph “b”, a sum equal to the wages of such individual for a normal workday shall be attributed to, or deemed to be payable to the individual with respect to, the first and each subsequent workday in such period until such amount so paid or owing is exhausted, not to exceed five workdays. Any individual receiving or entitled to receive wages as provided herein shall be ineligible for benefits for any week in which the sums equal or exceed the individual’s weekly benefit amount. If the amount is less than the weekly benefit amount of such individual, the individual’s benefits shall be reduced by such amount.\n\n#### d. Excess vacation payments\n\nNotwithstanding contrary provisions in paragraphs “a”, “b”, and “c”, if an individual is separated from employment and is scheduled to receive vacation payments during the period of unemployment attributable to the employer, then payments made by the employer to the individual or an obligation to make a payment by the employer to the individual for vacation pay, vacation pay allowance or pay in lieu of vacation shall not be deemed wages as defined in section 96.1A, subsection 40, for any period in excess of five workdays and such payments or the value of such obligations shall not be deducted for any period in excess of one week from the unemployment benefits the individual is otherwise entitled to receive under this chapter.\n\n#### e. Bonus payments\n\nIf an employer pays or is obligated to pay a bonus to an individual at the same time the employer pays or is obligated to pay vacation pay, a vacation pay allowance, or pay in lieu of vacation, the bonus shall not be deemed wages for purposes of determining benefit eligibility and amount, and the bonus shall not be deducted from unemployment benefits the individual is otherwise entitled to receive under this chapter.\n\n### 8. Administrative penalty\n\nIf the department finds that, with respect to any week of an insured worker’s unemployment for which such person claims credit or benefits, such person has, within the thirty-six calendar months immediately preceding such week, with intent to defraud by obtaining any benefits not due under this chapter, willfully and knowingly made a false statement or misrepresentation, or willfully and knowingly failed to disclose a material fact; such person shall be disqualified for the week in which the department makes such determination, and forfeit all benefit rights under the unemployment compensation law for a period of not more than the remaining benefit period as determined by the department according to the circumstances of each case. Any penalties imposed by this subsection shall be in addition to those otherwise prescribed in this chapter.\n\n### 9. Athletes — disqualified\n\nServices performed by an individual, substantially all of which consist of participating in sports or athletic events or training or preparing to so participate,"
